      'Shortly after that article was published, I had amazing conversations with fellow designers and engineers, largely around a single question — “how do we actually know that skeleton screens work?” A valid question — no definitive studies exist to validate the efficacy of the pattern (which, to us, seemed to make so much sense).\n\nSkeleton screens in different shapes and sizes are seemingly found everywhere across the web and apps — anywhere humans are forced to wait.\n\nBut do they actually work?'

      'The startup craze is global. In 2015, the U.K. brought 608,100 new companies to life, while Silicon Valley alone gave birth to more than 23,000 startups and China created a mind-boggling seven businesses a minute. If the founders of these companies have just one thing in common -- other than a love of kale shakes and ping-pong tables -- it is the drive to succeed.\n\nOne of the key decisions you must make as a startup leader is whether to seek funding or to bootstrap your business. Accelerator programs offer a middle ground and are often a go-to choice for those looking for new networks, mentorship and investment.'

      'Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service — BaaS — that started as a YC11 startup and grew up into a next-generation app-development platform on Google Cloud Platform.\n\nI’ve been using Firebase since 2013. I was late to the game :)\n\nI use Firebase to power my family’s business, Calligraphy.org. I also use it for everything I’ve developed in the last three years.\n\nFirebase frees developers to focus crafting fantastic user experiences. You don’t need to manage servers. You don’t need to write APIs. Firebase is your server, your API and your datastore, all written so generically that you can modify it to suit most needs. Yeah, you’ll occasionally need to use other bits of the Google Cloud for your advanced applications. Firebase can’t be everything to everybody. But it gets pretty close.'
